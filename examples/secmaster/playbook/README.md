These examples demonstrate various playbook deployment scenarios and configurations to help you orchestrate security
incident response workflows effectively.

## Overview

SecMaster playbooks are automated workflows that help security teams respond to security incidents efficiently.

When deploying SecMaster playbooks, consider the following best practices:

1. **Workspace Configuration**: Ensure your SecMaster workspace is properly configured before deploying playbooks
2. **Rule Design**: Design clear and specific rule conditions to avoid false positives
3. **Documentation**: Document your playbook configurations and workflows
4. **Version Control**: Use version control for your Terraform configurations
5. **Security**: Keep your credentials secure and never commit them to version control
