  protocol    = "HTTP"
  lb_method   = "ROUND_ROBIN"
  listener_id = "d9415786-5f1a-428b-b35f-2f1523e146d2"

  persistence {
    type        = "HTTP_COOKIE"
    cookie_name = "testCookie"

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the ELB pool resource.

    Changing this creates a new pool.

* `loadbalancer_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The load balancer on which to provision this

    Note:  One of LoadbalancerID or ListenerID must be provided.

* `listener_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The Listener on which the members of the pool
    will be associated with. Changing this creates a new pool.
	Note:  One of LoadbalancerID or ListenerID must be provided.
