## Import

DDS instance can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```sh
terraform import huaweicloud_dds_instance.instance 9c6d6ff2cba3434293fd479571517e16in02
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason.
The missing attributes include: `password`, `availability_zone`, `flavor`, configuration.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing an instance.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the instance, or the resource definition should be updated to
align with the instance. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_dds_instance" "instance" {
    ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      password, availability_zone, flavor, configuration,
    ]
  }
}
```
