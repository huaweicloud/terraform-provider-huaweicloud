# huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist

Manages a WAF blacklist and whitelist rule resource within HuaweiCloud.

-> **NOTE:** All WAF resources depend on WAF instances, and the WAF instances need to be purchased before they can be
used. The blacklist and whitelist rule resource can be used in Cloud Mode, Dedicated Mode and ELB Mode.

## Example Usage

### WAF rule blacklist and whitelist with ip address

```hcl
variable "policy_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist" "rule" {
  policy_id   = var.policy_id
  ip_address  = "192.168.0.0/24"
  action      = 0
  name        = "test_name"
  description = "test description"
}
```

### WAF rule blacklist and whitelist with address group

```hcl
variable "policy_id" {}
variable "address_group_id" {}
variable "enterprise_project_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist" "rule" {
  policy_id             = var.policy_id
  address_group_id      = var.address_group_id
  enterprise_project_id = var.enterprise_project_id
  action                = 1
  name                  = "test_name"
  description           = "test description"
}
```

  This parameter is required when `address_group_id` is not specified. The parameter `address_group_id` and `ip_address`
  can not be configured together.

* `address_group_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the WAF address group id.
  This parameter is required when `ip_address` is not specified. The parameter `address_group_id` and `ip_address`

## Import

There are two ways to import WAF rule blacklist state.

* Using `policy_id` and `rule_id`, separated by a slash, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist.test <policy_id>/<rule_id>
```

* Using `policy_id`, `rule_id` and `enterprise_project_id`, separated by slashes, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_waf_rule_blacklist.test <policy_id>/<rule_id>/<enterprise_project_id>
