Manage DMS Kafka instance resources within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

### Create a Kafka instance using flavor ID

```hcl
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "subnet_id" {}
variable "security_group_id" {}
variable "access_password" {}

variable "availability_zones" {
  default = ["your_availability_zones_a", "your_availability_zones_b", "your_availability_zones_c"]
}
variable "flavor_id" {
  default = "your_flavor_id, such: c6.2u4g.cluster"
}
variable "storage_spec_code" {
  default = "your_storage_spec_code, such: dms.physical.storage.ultra.v2"
}

# Query flavor information based on flavorID and storage I/O specification.
# Make sure the flavors are available in the availability zone.
data "huaweicloud_dms_kafka_flavors" "test" {
  type               = "cluster"
  flavor_id          = var.flavor_id
  availability_zones = var.availability_zones
  storage_spec_code  = var.storage_spec_code
}

resource "huaweicloud_dms_kafka_instance" "test" {
  name              = "kafka_test"
  vpc_id            = var.vpc_id
  network_id        = var.subnet_id
  security_group_id = var.security_group_id

  flavor_id          = data.huaweicloud_dms_kafka_flavors.test.flavor_id
  storage_spec_code  = data.huaweicloud_dms_kafka_flavors.test.flavors[0].ios[0].storage_spec_code
  availability_zones = var.availability_zones
  engine_version     = "2.7"
  storage_space      = 600

    value = "2"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the DMS Kafka instances. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this creates a new instance resource.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of the DMS Kafka instance. An instance name starts with a letter,
  consists of 4 to 64 characters, and supports only letters, digits, hyphens (-) and underscores (_).

* `flavor_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the Kafka [flavor ID](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/productdesc-kafka/Kafka-specification.html),
  e.g. **c6.2u4g.cluster**. This parameter and `product_id` are alternative.

  -> It is recommended to use `flavor_id` if the region supports it.

* `product_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies a product ID, which includes bandwidth, partition, broker and default
  storage capacity.

  -> **NOTE:** Change this to change the bandwidth, partition and broker of the Kafka instances. Please note that the
  broker changes may cause storage capacity changes. So, if you specify the value of `storage_space`, you need to
  manually modify the value of `storage_space` after changing the `product_id`.

* `engine_version` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the version of the Kafka engine,
  such as 1.1.0, 2.3.0, 2.7 or other supported versions. Changing this creates a new instance resource.

* `storage_spec_code` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the storage I/O specification.
  If the instance is created with `flavor_id`, the valid values are as follows:
  + **dms.physical.storage.high.v2**: Type of the disk that uses high I/O.
  + **dms.physical.storage.ultra.v2**: Type of the disk that uses ultra-high I/O.

  If the instance is created with `product_id`, the valid values are as follows:
  + **dms.physical.storage.high**: Type of the disk that uses high I/O.
    The corresponding bandwidths are **100MB** and **300MB**.
  + **dms.physical.storage.ultra**: Type of the disk that uses ultra-high I/O.
    The corresponding bandwidths are **100MB**, **300MB**, **600MB** and **1,200MB**.

  Changing this creates a new instance resource.

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of a VPC. Changing this creates a new instance resource.

* `network_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of a subnet. Changing this creates a new instance
  resource.

* `security_group_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the ID of a security group.

* `availability_zones` - (Required, List, ForceNew) The names of the AZ where the Kafka instances reside.
  The parameter value can not be left blank or an empty array. Changing this creates a new instance resource.

  -> **NOTE:** Deploy one availability zone or at least three availability zones. Do not select two availability zones.
  Deploy to more availability zones, the better the reliability and SLA coverage.

  the following character types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters (`~!@#$%^&*()-_
  =+\\|[{}]:'",<.>/?). Changing this creates a new instance resource.

* `storage_space` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the message storage capacity, the unit is GB.
  The storage spaces corresponding to the product IDs are as follows:

* `security_protocol` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the protocol to use after SASL is enabled. Value options:
  + **SASL_SSL**: Data is encrypted with SSL certificates for high-security transmission.
  + **SASL_PLAINTEXT**: Data is transmitted in plaintext with username and password authentication. This protocol only
    uses the SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism and delivers high performance.
  
  Defaults to **SASL_SSL**. Changing this creates a new instance resource.

* `enabled_mechanisms` - (Optional, List, ForceNew) Specifies the authentication mechanisms to use after SASL is
  enabled. Value options:

  and `maintain_end` must be set in pairs. If parameter `maintain_begin` is left blank, parameter `maintain_end` is also
  blank. In this case, the system automatically allocates the default start time 02:00.

* `maintain_end` - (Optional, String) Specifies the time at which a maintenance time window ends. Format: HH:mm. The
  start time and end time of a maintenance time window must indicate the time segment of a supported maintenance time
  window. The end time is four hours later than the start time. For example, if the start time is 22:00, the end time is
  02:00. Parameters `maintain_begin`
  and `maintain_end` must be set in pairs. If parameter `maintain_end` is left blank, parameter
  `maintain_begin` is also blank. In this case, the system automatically allocates the default end time 06:00.

* `public_ip_ids` - (Optional, List) Specifies the IDs of the elastic IP address (EIP)
  bound to the DMS Kafka instance. Changing this creates a new instance resource.
  + If the instance is created with `flavor_id`, the total number of public IPs is equal to `broker_num`.

## Import

DMS Kafka instance can be imported using the instance id, e.g.

```
 $ terraform import huaweicloud_dms_kafka_instance.instance_1 8d3c7938-dc47-4937-a30f-c80de381c5e3
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason. The missing attributes include:
`password`, `manager_password`, `public_ip_ids`, `security_protocol`, `enabled_mechanisms` and `arch_type`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing
a DMS Kafka instance. You can then decide if changes should be applied to the instance, or the resource definition
should be updated to align with the instance. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_dms_kafka_instance" "instance_1" {
    ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      password, manager_password,
    ]
  }
}
```
