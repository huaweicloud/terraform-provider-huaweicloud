# huaweicloud_ces_alarmrule

Manages a Cloud Eye alarm rule resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

### Basic example

```hcl
variable "instance_id_1" {}
variable "instance_id_2" {}
variable "topic_urn" {}

resource "huaweicloud_ces_alarmrule" "test" {
  alarm_name           = "rule-test"
  alarm_action_enabled = true
  alarm_enabled        = true
  alarm_type           = "MULTI_INSTANCE"

  metric {
    namespace = "SYS.ECS"
  }

  resources {
    dimensions {
      name  = "instance_id"
      value = var.instance_id_1
    }
  }

  resources {
    dimensions {
      name  = "instance_id"
      value = var.instance_id_2
    }
  }

  condition  {
    period              = 1200
    filter              = "average"
    comparison_operator = ">"
    value               = 6.5
    unit                = "B/s"
    count               = 1
    suppress_duration   = 300
    metric_name         = "network_outgoing_bytes_rate_inband"
    alarm_level         = 4
  }

  condition  {
    period              = 3600
    filter              = "average"
    comparison_operator = ">="
    value               = 20
    unit                = "B/s"
    count               = 1
    suppress_duration   = 300
    metric_name         = "network_outgoing_bytes_rate_inband"
    alarm_level         = 4
  }

  alarm_actions {
    type              = "notification"
    notification_list = [
      var.topic_urn
    ]
  }
}
```

### Alarm rule for All instance

```hcl
variable "topic_urn" {}

resource "huaweicloud_ces_alarmrule" "test" {
  alarm_name           = "rule-test"
  alarm_action_enabled = true
  alarm_enabled        = true
  alarm_type           = "ALL_INSTANCE"

  metric {
    namespace = "AGT.ECS"
  }

  resources {
    dimensions {
      name = "instance_id"
    }

    dimensions {
      name = "mount_point"
    }
  }

  condition  {
    alarm_level         = 2
    suppress_duration   = 0
    period              = 1
    filter              = "average"
    comparison_operator = ">"
    value               = 80
    count               = 1
    metric_name         = "disk_usedPercent"

    type              = "notification"
    notification_list = [
      var.topic_urn
    ]
  }
}
```

### Alarm rule for event monitoring

```hcl
variable "topic_urn" {}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `alarm_actions` - (Optional, List) Specifies the action triggered by an alarm. The structure is described
  below.

* `ok_actions` - (Optional, List) Specifies the action triggered by the clearing of an alarm. The structure is

and ok_actions coexist, their corresponding notification_list must be of the **same value**.

The `metric` block supports:

* `namespace` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the namespace in **service.item** format. **service** and **item**
  each must be a string that starts with a letter and contains only letters, digits, and underscores (_).
  Changing this creates a new resource.
