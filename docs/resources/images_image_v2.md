# huaweicloud_images_image_v2

Manages a Image resource within HuaweiCloud IMS.

!> **WARNING:** It has been deprecated, please use `huaweicloud_images_image` instead.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_images_image_v2" "rancheros" {
  name             = "RancherOS"
  image_source_url = "https://releases.rancher.com/os/latest/rancheros-openstack.img"
  container_format = "bare"
  disk_format      = "qcow2"
  tags             = [
    "foo.bar",
    "tag.value"
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `container_format` - (Required) The container format. Must be "bare".

* `disk_format` - (Required) The disk format. Must be one of "qcow2", "vhd".

* `local_file_path` - (Optional) This is the filepath of the raw image file that will be uploaded to Glance. Conflicts
  with `image_source_url`.

* `image_cache_path` - (Optional) This is the directory where the images will be downloaded. Images will be stored with
  a filename corresponding to the md5 hash of URL. Defaults to "$HOME/.terraform/image_cache"

* `image_source_url` - (Optional) This is the url of the raw image that will be downloaded in the `image_cache_path`
  before being uploaded to Glance. Glance is able to download image from internet but the `golangsdk` library does not
  yet provide a way to do so. Conflicts with `local_file_path`.

* `min_disk_gb` - (Optional) Amount of disk space (in GB) required to boot image. Defaults to 0.

* `min_ram_mb` - (Optional) Amount of ram (in MB) required to boot image. Defaults to 0.

* `name` - (Required) The name of the image.

* `protected` - (Optional) If true, image will not be deletable. Defaults to false.

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to create the V2 Glance client. A Glance client is needed to create an Image
  that can be used with a compute instance. If omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this
  creates a new Image.

* `tags` - (Optional) The tags of the image. It must be a list of strings. At this time, it is not possible to delete
  all tags of an image.

* `visibility` - (Optional) The visibility of the image. Must be "private". The ability to set the visibility depends
  upon the configuration of the HuaweiCloud cloud.

Note: The `properties` attribute handling in the golangsdk library is currently buggy and needs to be fixed before being
implemented in this resource.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `checksum` - The checksum of the data associated with the image.
* `created_at` - The date the image was created.
* `file` - the trailing path after the glance endpoint that represent the location of the image or the path to retrieve
  it.
* `id` - A unique ID assigned by Glance.
* `metadata` - The metadata associated with the image.
  Image metadata allow for meaningfully define the image properties and tags.
  See [metadata reference](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/metadefs-concepts.html).
* `owner` - The id of the HuaweiCloud user who owns the image.
* `schema` - The path to the JSON-schema that represent the image or image
* `size_bytes` - The size in bytes of the data associated with the image.
* `status` - The status of the image. It can be "queued", "active"
  or "saving".
* `update_at` - The date the image was last updated.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 30 minutes.

## Import

Images can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_images_image_v2.rancheros 89c60255-9bd6-460c-822a-e2b959ede9d2
```
