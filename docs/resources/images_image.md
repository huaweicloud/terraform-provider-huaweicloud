data resource "huaweicloud_compute_instance" "test" {
  name = var.instance_name
}

resource "huaweicloud_images_image" "test" {
  name        = var.image_name
  instance_id = data.huaweicloud_compute_instance.test.id
  description = "created by Terraform"

  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
    key = "value"
  }
}
```

### Creating an image from OBS bucket

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_images_image" "ims_test_file" {
  name        = "ims_test_file"
  image_url   = "ims-image:centos70.qcow2"
  min_disk    = 40
  description = "Create an image from the OBS bucket."

  tags = {
    foo = "bar1"
    key = "value"
  }
}
```

* `data_origin` - The image resource. The pattern can be 'instance,*instance_id*' or 'file,*image_url*'.

* `disk_format` - The image file format. The value can be `vhd`, `zvhd`, `raw`, `zvhd2`, or `qcow2`.

* `image_size` - The size(bytes) of the image file format.
