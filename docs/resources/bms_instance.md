## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the instance. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies a unique name for the instance. The name consists of 1 to 63 characters,
  including letters, digits, underscores (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.).

* `image_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the image ID of the desired image for the instance. Changing this
  creates a new instance.

* `flavor_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the flavor ID of the desired flavor for the instance. Changing
  this creates a new instance.

* `user_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the user ID. You can obtain the user ID from My Credential on the
  management console. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `availability_zone` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the availability zone in which to create the instance.
  Please following [reference](https://developer.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/endpoint?BMS)
  for the values. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies id of vpc in which to create the instance. Changing this creates a
  new instance.

* `nics` - (Required, List) Specifies an array of one or more networks to attach to the instance. The network
  object structure is documented below.

* `admin_pass` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the login password of the administrator for logging in to the
  BMS using password authentication. Changing this creates a new instance. The password must meet the following
  complexity requirements:
  + Contains 8 to 26 characters.
  + Contains at least three of the following character types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special
    characters !@$%^-_=+[{}]:,./?
  + Cannot contain the username or the username in reverse.

* `key_pair` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the name of a key pair for logging in to the BMS using key pair
  authentication. The key pair must already be created and associated with the tenant's account. The parameter is
  required when using a Windows image to create a BMS. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `user_data` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the user data to be injected during the instance creation. Text
  and text files can be injected. `user_data` can come from a variety of sources: inline, read in from the *file*
  function. The content of `user_data` can be plaint text or encoded with base64. Changing this creates a new instance.

-> **NOTE:** 1. If the `user_data` field is specified for a Linux BMS that is created using an image with Cloud-Init
  installed, the `admin_pass` field becomes invalid.
        <br/>2. If both `key_name` and `user_data` are specified, `user_data` only injects user data.

* `security_groups` - (Optional, List, ForceNew) Specifies an array of one or more security group IDs to associate with
  the instance. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `eip_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The ID of the EIP. Changing this creates a new instance.

  contains of *SSD*, *GPSSD* and *SAS*. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `size` - (Required, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the data disk size, in GB. The value ranges form 10 to 32768. Changing
  this creates a new instance.
