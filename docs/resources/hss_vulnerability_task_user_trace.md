# huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_task_user_trace

Manages an HSS vulnerability task user trace recording resource within HuaweiCloud.

-> This resource is a one-time action resource used to record the last time a user viewed vulnerability tasks.
   Deleting this resource will not clear the corresponding request record, but will only remove the resource
   information from the Terraform state file.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "task_type" {}

resource "huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_task_user_trace" "example" {
  task_type = var.task_type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the resource. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `task_type` - (Required, String, NonUpdatable) Specifies the type of the vulnerability task. The value can be:
  + **vul_scan**: Indicates a vulnerability scan task.
  + **vul_repair**: Indicates a vulnerability repair task.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, NonUpdatable) Specifies the enterprise project ID.
  This parameter is valid only when the enterprise project is enabled.
  The default value is **0**, indicating the default enterprise project.
  If it is necessary to operate the hosts under all enterprise projects, the value is **all_granted_eps**.
  If you only have permissions for a specific enterprise project, you need set the enterprise project ID. Otherwise,
  the operation may fail due to insufficient permissions.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The resource ID.
