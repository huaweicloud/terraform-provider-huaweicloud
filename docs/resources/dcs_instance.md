# huaweicloud_dcs_instance

Manages a DCS instance within HuaweiCloud.

!> **WARNING:** DCS for Memcached is about to become unavailable and is no longer sold in some regions.
You can use DCS for Redis 4.0, 5.0 or 6.0 instead. It is not possible to create Memcached instances through this resource.
You can use this resource to manage Memcached instances that exist in HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

### Create a single mode Redis instance

```hcl
variable vpc_id {}
variable subnet_id {}

data "huaweicloud_dcs_flavors" "single_flavors" {
  cache_mode = "single"
  capacity   = 0.125
}

resource "huaweicloud_dcs_instance" "instance_1" {
  name               = "redis_single_instance"
  engine             = "Redis"
  engine_version     = "5.0"
  capacity           = data.huaweicloud_dcs_flavors.single_flavors.capacity
  flavor             = data.huaweicloud_dcs_flavors.single_flavors.flavors[0].name
  availability_zones = ["cn-north-1a"]
  password           = "YourPassword@123"
  vpc_id             = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id          = var.subnet_id
}
```

### Create Master/Standby mode Redis instances with backup policy

```hcl
variable vpc_id {}
variable subnet_id {}

resource "huaweicloud_dcs_instance" "instance_2" {
  name               = "redis_name"
  engine             = "Redis"
  engine_version     = "5.0"
  capacity           = 4
  flavor             = "redis.ha.xu1.large.r2.4"
  # The first is the primary availability zone (cn-north-1a),
  # and the second is the standby availability zone (cn-north-1b).
  availability_zones = ["cn-north-1a", "cn-north-1b"]
  password           = "YourPassword@123"
  vpc_id             = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id          = var.subnet_id

  charging_mode = "prePaid"
  period_unit   = "month"
  auto_renew    = "true"
  period        = "1"

  backup_policy {
    backup_type = "auto"
    save_days   = 3
    backup_at   = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    begin_at    = "02:00-04:00"
  }

  whitelists {
    group_name = "test-group1"
    ip_address = ["192.168.10.100", "192.168.0.0/24"]
  }
  whitelists {
    group_name = "test-group2"
    ip_address = ["172.16.10.100", "172.16.0.0/24"]
  }

  parameters {
    id    = "1"
    name  = "timeout"
    value = "500"
  }
  parameters {
    id    = "3"
    name  = "hash-max-ziplist-entries"
    value = "4096"
  }
}
```

## Import

DCS instance can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
terraform import huaweicloud_dcs_instance.instance_1 80e373f9-872e-4046-aae9-ccd9ddc55511
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason.
The missing attributes include: `password`, `auto_renew`, `period`, `period_unit`, `rename_commands`,
`internal_version`, `save_days`, `backup_type`, `begin_at`, `period_type`, `backup_at`, `parameters`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing an instance.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the instance, or the resource definition should be updated to
align with the instance. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_dcs_instance" "instance_1" {
    ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      password, rename_commands,
    ]
  }
}
```
