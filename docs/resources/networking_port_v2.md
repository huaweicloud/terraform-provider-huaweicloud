# huaweicloud_networking_port

Manages a Port resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "huaweicloud_vpc_subnet" "mynet" {
  name = "subnet-default"
}

resource "huaweicloud_networking_port" "myport" {
  name           = "port"
  network_id     = data.huaweicloud_vpc_subnet.mynet.id
  admin_state_up = "true"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the networking port resource. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this creates a new port resource.

* `name` - (Optional, String) A unique name for the port. Changing this updates the `name` of an existing port.

* `network_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) The ID of the network to attach the port to. Changing this creates a new
  port.

* `mac_address` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specify a specific MAC address for the port. Changing this creates a new
  port.

* `device_owner` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The device owner of the Port. Changing this creates a new port.

* `security_group_ids` - (Optional, List) Conflicts with `no_security_groups`. A list of security group IDs to apply to
  the port. The security groups must be specified by ID and not name (as opposed to how they are configured with the
  Compute Instance).

* `no_security_groups` - (Optional, List) Conflicts with `security_group_ids`. If set to
  `true`, then no security groups are applied to the port. If set to `false` and no `security_group_ids` are specified,
  then the Port will yield to the default behavior of the Networking service, which is to usually apply the "default"
  security group.

* `device_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The ID of the device attached to the port. Changing this creates a new
  port.

* `fixed_ip` - (Optional, List) An array of desired IPs for this port. The structure is described below.

* `allowed_address_pairs` - (Optional, List) An IP/MAC Address pair of additional IP addresses that can be active on
  this port. The structure is described below.

* `extra_dhcp_option` - (Optional, List) An extra DHCP option that needs to be configured on the port. The structure is
  described below. Can be specified multiple times.

* `value_specs` - (Optional, Map, ForceNew) Map of additional options.

The `fixed_ip` block supports:

* `subnet_id` - (Required, String) Subnet in which to allocate IP address for this port.

* `ip_address` - (Optional, String) IP address desired in the subnet for this port. If you don't specify `ip_address`,
  an available IP address from the specified subnet will be allocated to this port. This field will not be populated if
  it is left blank. To retrieve the assigned IP address, use the `all_fixed_ips`
  attribute.

The `allowed_address_pairs` block supports:

* `ip_address` - (Required, String) The additional IP address.

* `mac_address` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The additional MAC address.

The `extra_dhcp_option` block supports:

* `name` - (Required, String) Name of the DHCP option.

* `value` - (Required, String) Value of the DHCP option.

* `ip_version` - (Optional, Int) IP protocol version. Defaults to 4.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Specifies a resource ID in UUID format.
* `all_fixed_ips` - The collection of Fixed IP addresses on the port in the order returned by the Network v2 API.
* `all_security_group_ids` - The collection of Security Group IDs on the port which have been explicitly and implicitly
  added.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 10 minutes.
* `delete` - Default is 10 minutes.

## Import

Ports can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_networking_port.port_1 eae26a3e-1c33-4cc1-9c31-0cd729c438a1
```
