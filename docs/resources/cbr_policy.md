# huaweicloud_cbr_policy

Manages a backup policy for backing up vault objects within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

### Create a backup policy (weekly backup)

```hcl
variable "policy_name" {}

resource "huaweicloud_cbr_policy" "test" {
  name        = var.policy_name
  type        = "backup"
  time_period = 20
  time_zone   = "UTC+08:00"

  long_term_retention {
    daily                = 10
    weekly               = 10
    monthly              = 1
    full_backup_interval = -1
  }

  backup_cycle {
    days            = "SA,SU"
    execution_times = ["08:00", "20:00"]
  }
}
```

### Create a replication policy (periodic backup)

```hcl
variable "policy_name" {}
variable "destination_region" {}
variable "destination_project_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_cbr_policy" "test" {
  name                   = var.policy_name
  type                   = "replication"
  destination_region     = var.destination_region
  destination_project_id = var.destination_project_id
  backup_quantity        = 20

  backup_cycle {
    interval        = 5
    execution_times = ["21:00"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region where the policy is located. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new policy.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the policy name.  
  This parameter can contain a maximum of `64`
  characters, which may consist of chinese characters, letters, digits, underscores(_) and hyphens (-).

* `type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the protection type of the policy.
  Valid values are **backup** and **replication**.
  Changing this will create a new policy.

* `backup_cycle` - (Required, List) Specifies the scheduling rule for the policy backup execution.
  The [object](#cbr_policy_backup_cycle) structure is documented below.

* `enabled` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to enable the policy. Default to **true**.

* `destination_region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the name of the replication destination region, which is mandatory
  for cross-region replication. Required if `protection_type` is **replication**.

* `enable_acceleration` - (Optional, Bool, ForceNew) Specifies whether to enable the acceleration function to shorten
  the replication time for cross-region.  
  Changing this will create a new policy.

* `destination_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ID of the replication destination project, which is
  mandatory for cross-region replication. Required if `protection_type` is **replication**.

* `backup_quantity` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the maximum number of retained backups. The value ranges from `2` to
  `99,999`. This parameter and `time_period` are alternative.

* `time_period` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the duration (in days) for retained backups. The value ranges from `2` to
  `99,999`.

-> **NOTE:** If this `backup_quantity` and `time_period` are both left blank, the backups will be retained permanently.

* `long_term_retention` - (Optional, List) Specifies the long-term retention rules, which is an advanced options of
  the `backup_quantity`. The [object](#cbr_policy_long_term_retention) structure is documented below.

-> The configuration of `long_term_retention` and `backup_quantity` will take effect together.
  When the number of retained backups exceeds the preset value (number of `backup_quantity`), the system automatically
  deletes the earliest backups. By default, the system automatically clears data every other day.

* `time_zone` - (Optional, String) Specifies the UTC time zone, e.g. `UTC+08:00`.
  Only available if `long_term_retention` is set.

<a name="cbr_policy_backup_cycle"></a>
The `backup_cycle` block supports:

* `days` - (Optional, String) Specifies the weekly backup day of backup schedule.  
  It supports seven days a week (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU) and this parameter is separated by a comma (,) without
  spaces, between date and date during the configuration.

* `interval` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the interval (in days) of backup schedule.  
  The valid value ranges from `1` to `30`.

-> Parameter `backup_cycle.days` and `backup_cycle.interval` are alternative.

* `execution_times` - (Required, List) Specifies the backup time. Automated backups will be triggered at the backup
  time. The current time is in the UTC format (HH:MM). The minutes in the list must be set to **00** and the hours
  cannot be repeated. In the replication policy, you are advised to set one time point for one day.

<a name="cbr_policy_long_term_retention"></a>
The `long_term_retention` block supports:

* `daily` - (Optional, Int) - Specifies the latest backup of each day is saved in the long term.

* `weekly` - (Optional, Int) - Specifies the latest backup of each week is saved in the long term.

* `monthly` - (Optional, Int) - Specifies the latest backup of each month is saved in the long term.

* `yearly` - (Optional, Int) - Specifies the latest backup of each year is saved in the long term.

-> A maximum of 10 backups are retained for failed periodic backup tasks. They are retained for one month and can be
  manually deleted on the web console.

* `full_backup_interval` - (Optional, Int) Specifies how often (after how many incremental backups) a full backup is
  performed. The valid value ranges from `-1` to `100`.
  If `-1` is specified, full backup will not be performed.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - A resource ID in UUID format.

## Import

Policies can be imported by their `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_cbr_policy.test <id>
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to the attribute missing from the
API response. The missing attribute is: `enable_acceleration`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing a policy.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the policy, or the resource definition should be updated to align
with the policy. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_cbr_policy" "test" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      enable_acceleration,
    ]
  }
}
```
