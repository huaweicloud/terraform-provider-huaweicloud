Manages a GA accelerator resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "name" {}
variable "description" {}

resource "huaweicloud_ga_accelerator" "test" {
  name        = var.name
  description = var.description

  ip_sets {
    area = "CM"
  }

  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
    key = "value"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the global accelerator name.  
  The name can contain `1` to `64` characters, only letters, digits, and hyphens (-) are allowed.

* `ip_sets` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Specifies the IP addresses assigned to the global accelerator.
  The [AccelerateIp](#Accelerator_AccelerateIp) structure is documented below.

  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `description` - (Optional, String) Specifies the description about the global accelerator.  
  The description contain a maximum of `255` characters, and the angle brackets (< and >) are not allowed.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the enterprise project ID of the tenant.
  The value is **0** or a string that contains a maximum of 36 characters in UUID format with hyphens (-).
  **0** indicates the default enterprise project. Defaults to **0**.

* `tags` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the key/value pairs to associate with the global accelerator.

<a name="Accelerator_AccelerateIp"></a>
The `AccelerateIp` block supports:

* `area` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the acceleration area. The value can be one of the following:
  + **OUTOFCM**: Outside the Chinese mainland
  + **CM**: Chinese mainland

  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `ip_type` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the IP address version. Only **IPV4** is supported for now.

  + **DELETING**: The resource is being deleted.

* `flavor_id` - Indicates the specification ID.

* `ip_sets` - Indicates the IP addresses assigned to the global accelerator.
  The [AccelerateIp](#Accelerator_AccelerateIpResp) structure is documented below.

* `frozen_info` - Indicates the frozen details of cloud services or resources.
  The [FrozenInfo](#Accelerator_FrozenInfo) structure is documented below.

* `created_at` - Indicates when the global accelerator was created.

* `updated_at` - Indicates when the global accelerator was updated.

<a name="Accelerator_AccelerateIpResp"></a>
The `AccelerateIp` block supports:

* `ip_address` - Indicates the IP address.

<a name="Accelerator_FrozenInfo"></a>
The `FrozenInfo` block supports:

* `effect` - Indicates the status of the resource after being frozen. The value can be one of the following:
  + **1** (default): The resource is frozen and can be released.
  + **2**: The resource is frozen and cannot be released.
  + **3**: The resource is frozen and cannot be renewed.

* `scene` - Indicates the service scenario. The value can be one of the following:
