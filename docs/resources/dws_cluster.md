Manages Cluster in the Data Warehouse Service.

## Example Usage

### Dws Cluster Example

```hcl
variable "availability_zone" {}
variable "network_id" {}
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "user_name" {}
variable "user_pwd" {}
variable "dws_cluster_name" {}

resource "huaweicloud_networking_secgroup" "secgroup" {
  name        = "security_group_2"
  description = "terraform security group"
}

resource "huaweicloud_dws_cluster" "cluster" {
  node_type         = "dws.m3.xlarge"
  number_of_node    = 3
  network_id        = var.network_id
  vpc_id            = var.vpc_id
  security_group_id = huaweicloud_networking_secgroup.secgroup.id
  availability_zone = var.availability_zone
  name              = var.dws_cluster_name
  user_name         = var.user_name
  user_pwd          = var.user_pwd
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the cluster resource. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this creates a new cluster resource.

* `name` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Cluster name, which must be unique and contains 4 to 64 characters, which
  consist of letters, digits, hyphens(-), or underscores(_) only and must start with a letter.

* `network_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Network ID, which is used for configuring cluster network.

* `node_type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Node type.

* `number_of_node` - (Required, Int) Number of nodes in a cluster. The value ranges from 3 to 32. When expanding,
  add at least 3 nodes.

* `security_group_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) ID of a security group. The ID is used for configuring cluster
  network.

* `user_name` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Administrator username for logging in to a data warehouse cluster The
  administrator username must:  Consist of lowercase letters, digits, or underscores. Start with a lowercase letter or
  an underscore. Contain 1 to 63 characters. Cannot be a keyword of the DWS database.

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) VPC ID, which is used for configuring cluster network.

* `user_pwd` - (Required, String) Administrator password for logging in to a data warehouse cluster A password
  must conform to the following rules:  Contains 8 to 32 characters. Cannot be the same as the username or the username
  written in reverse order. Contains three types of the following:
  Lowercase letters Uppercase letters Digits Special characters
  ~!@#%^&*()-_=+|[{}];:,<.>/?

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the enterprise project id of the dws cluster,
  Value 0 indicates the default enterprise project.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `availability_zone` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) AZ in a cluster.

* `port` - (Optional, Int) Service port of a cluster (8000 to 10000). The default value is 8000.

* `public_ip` - (Optional, List, ForceNew) A nested object resource Structure is documented below.

The `public_ip` block supports:

* `eip_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) EIP ID.

* `public_bind_type` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Binding type of an EIP. The value can be either of the following:
  auto_assign not_use bind_existing The default value is not_use.

* `number_of_cn` - (Optional, int, ForceNew) Specifies the number of CN. If you use a large-scale cluster, deploy
  multiple CNs.

* `tags` - (Optional, Map, ForceNew) Specifies the key/value pairs to associate with the cluster.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 60 minute.
* `update` - Default is 60 minute.
* `delete` - Default is 60 minute.

## Import

Cluster can be imported using the following format:

```
$ terraform import huaweicloud_dws_cluster.test 47ad727e-9dcc-4833-bde0-bb298607c719
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason. The missing attributes include: `user_pwd`, `number_of_cn`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing a cluster.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the cluster, or the resource definition
should be updated to align with the cluster. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```
resource "huaweicloud_dws_cluster" "test" {
    ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      user_pwd, number_of_cn,
    ]
  }
}
```
