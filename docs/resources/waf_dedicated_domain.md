# huaweicloud_waf_dedicated_domain

Manages a dedicated mode domain resource within HuaweiCloud.

-> **NOTE:** All WAF resources depend on WAF instances, and the WAF instances need to be purchased before they can be
used. The dedicated mode domain name resource can be used in Dedicated Mode.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "certificated_id" {}
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "enterprise_project_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_waf_dedicated_domain" "test" {
  domain                = "www.example.com"
  certificate_id        = var.certificated_id

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the dedicated mode domain resource.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this setting will push a new domain.

* `domain` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the protected domain name or IP address (port allowed). For example,
  `www.example.com` or `*.example.com` or `www.example.com:89`. Changing this creates a new domain.

* `server` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Specifies the server configuration list of the domain.
  A maximum of `80` can be configured. The [server](#DedicatedDomain_server) structure is documented below.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the enterprise project ID of WAF dedicated domain.
  For enterprise users, if omitted, default enterprise project will be used.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

  This field is used to store the real IP address of the client. After the configuration, WAF preferentially reads the
  configured field to obtain the real IP address of the client. If multiple fields are configured, WAF reads the IP
  address list in order. Note:
  + If you want to use a TCP connection IP address as the client IP address, set IP Tag to `$remote_addr`.
  + If WAF does not obtain the real IP address of a client from fields you configure, WAF reads the `cdn-src-ip`,
    `x-real-ip`, `x-forwarded-for` and `$remote_addr` fields in sequence to read the client IP address.
