# huaweicloud_workspace_service

Use this resource to register or unregister the Workspace service in HuaweiCloud.

-> **NOTE:** Only one resource can be created in a region.

## Example Usage

### Register the Workspace service and use local authentication

```hcl
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "network_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "huaweicloud_workspace_service" "test" {
  access_mode = "INTERNET"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id
  network_ids = var.network_ids

  otp_config_info {
    enable       = true
    receive_mode = "VMFA"
    rule_type    = "ACCESS_MODE"
    rule         = "PRIVATE"
  }
}
```

### Register the Workspace service and connect to the AD domain

```hcl
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "network_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

variable "ad_domain_name" {}
variable "ad_server_admin_account" {}
variable "ad_server_admin_password" {}
variable "ad_master_domain_ip" {}
variable "ad_server_name" {}
variable "ad_master_dns_ip" {}

resource "huaweicloud_workspace_service" "test" {
  auth_type   = "LOCAL_AD"
  access_mode = "INTERNET"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id
  network_ids = var.network_ids

  ad_domain {
    name               = var.ad_domain_name
    admin_account      = var.ad_server_admin_account
    password           = var.ad_server_admin_password
    active_domain_ip   = var.ad_master_domain_ip
    active_domain_name = format("%s.%s", var.ad_server_name, var.ad_domain_name)
    active_dns_ip      = var.ad_master_dns_ip
  }

  otp_config_info {
    enable       = true
    receive_mode = "VMFA"
    rule_type    = "ACCESS_MODE"
    rule         = "PRIVATE"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to register the Workspace service.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the VPC ID to which the service belongs.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

  -> The resources required by Workspace will be created in the selected VPC subnet. After the configuration is saved,
     the VPC cannot be modified.

* `network_ids` - (Required, List) The network ID list of subnets that the service have.
  The subnets corresponding to this parameter must be included in the VPC resource corresponding to `vpc_id`.
  These subnet segments cannot conflict with `172.16.0.0/12`.

  -> The subnet of first registry must be selected. The DNS server address of the selected subnet will be automatically
     changed. Do not manually change it. You are advised to select a dedicated Workspace subnet and ensure that the DHCP
     function of the subnet is enabled.

* `access_mode` - (Required, String) Specifies the access mode of Workspace service.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **INTERNET**: internet access.
  + **DEDICATED**: dedicated line access.
  + **BOTH**: both internet access and dedicated access are supported.

* `auth_type` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the authentication type of Workspace service.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **LITE_AS**: Local authentication.
  + **LOCAL_AD**: Connect to AD domain.

  Defaults to **LITE_AS**. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `ad_domain` - (Optional, List) Specifies the configuration of AD domain.
  Required if `auth_type` is **LOCAL_AD**. Make sure that the selected VPC network and the network to which AD
  belongs can be connected. The [object](#service_domain) structure is documented below.

  -> If AD domain is enabled, you need to connect the cloud desktop and Windows AD network.  
     If Windows AD is deployed in the intranet of the customer data center, these
     [ports](#secgroup_rules_for_ad_domain_connection) need to be opened in the firewall.

* `enterprise_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the enterprise ID.
  The enterprise ID is the unique identification in the Workspace service.
  If omitted, the system will automatically generate an enterprise ID.
  The ID can contain `1` to `32` characters, only letters, digits, hyphens (-) and underscores (_) are allowed.

* `internet_access_port` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the internet access port.
  The valid value is range from `1,025` to `65,535`.
  
  -> If you want to modify the internet access port, please open a service ticket to enable this function.  
  
* `dedicated_subnets` - (Optional, List) The subnet segments of the dedicated access.

* `management_subnet_cidr` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The subnet segment of the management component.

* `lock_enabled` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to allow the provider to automatically unlock locked service
  when it is running. The default value is **false**.

* `otp_config_info` - (Optional, List) Specifies the configuration of auxiliary authentication.
  The [object](#config_info) structure is documented below.
