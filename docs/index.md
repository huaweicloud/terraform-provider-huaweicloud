# HuaweiCloud Provider

The HuaweiCloud provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by HuaweiCloud. The provider needs to be
configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

-> **NOTE:** You can also use this provider to interact with resources supported by HCSO if the API is compatible
with HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    huaweicloud = {
      source  = "huaweicloud/huaweicloud"
      version = ">= 1.36.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the HuaweiCloud Provider
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region     = "cn-north-4"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "huaweicloud_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my_vpc"
  cidr = "192.168.0.0/16"
}
```

Terraform 0.12 and earlier:

```hcl
# Configure the HuaweiCloud Provider
provider "huaweicloud" {
  version    = ">= 1.36.0"
  region     = "cn-north-4"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "huaweicloud_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my_vpc"
  cidr = "192.168.0.0/16"
}
```

## Authentication

The Huawei Cloud provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are
supported, in this order, and explained below:

* Static credentials
* Environment variables
* Shared configuration file
* ECS Instance Metadata Service

The Huawei Cloud Provider supports assuming role with IAM agency, either in the provider configuration
block parameter assume_role or shared configuration file.

### Static credentials

!> **WARNING:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage
should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `access_key` and `secret_key`
in-line in the provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region     = "cn-north-4"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}
```

Temporary security credentials can be provided by adding an `security_token` with `access_key` and `secret_key`
in-line in the provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region         = "cn-north-4"
  access_key     = "my-access-key"
  secret_key     = "my-secret-key"
  security_token = "my-security-token"
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via the `HW_ACCESS_KEY` and
`HW_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, representing your Huawei Cloud Access Key and Secret Key, respectively.
For temporary security credentials, need to add one more environment variable `HW_SECURITY_TOKEN`.

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export HW_ACCESS_KEY="anaccesskey"
$ export HW_SECRET_KEY="asecretkey"
$ export HW_REGION_NAME="cn-north-4"
$ terraform plan
```

### Shared Configuration File

You can use a
[HuaweiCloud CLI configuration file](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-hcli/hcli_03_002.html)
to specify your credentials. You need to specify a location in the Terraform configuration by providing the
`shared_config_file` argument or using the `HW_SHARED_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
This method also supports a `profile` configuration and matching `HW_PROFILE` environment variable:

-> **NOTE:** The CLI configuration file can not be used directly by terraform, you need to skip encrypting
authentication information in the configuration file by running the following command:

```sh
hcloud configure set --cli-auth-encrypt=false
```

Usage:

```terraform
provider "huaweicloud" {
  shared_config_file = "/home/tf_user/.hcloud/config.json"
  profile            = "customprofile"
}
```

### ECS Instance Metadata Service

If you're running Terraform from an ECS instance with Agency configured, Terraform will just ask
[the metadata API](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-ecs/ecs_03_0166.html)
for credentials.

This is a preferred approach over any other when running in ECS as you can avoid
hard coding credentials. Instead these are leased on-the-fly by Terraform
which reduces the chance of leakage.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region = "cn-north-4"
}
```

### Assume role

If provided with an IAM agency, Terraform will attempt to assume this role using the supplied credentials.

Usage:

```hcl
provider "huaweicloud" {
  region     = "cn-north-4"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"

  assume_role {
    agency_name = "agency"
    domain_name = "agency_domain"
  }
}
```

## Testing and Development

In order to run the Acceptance Tests for development, the following environment variables must also be set:

* `HW_REGION_NAME` - The region in which to create the resources.

* `HW_ACCESS_KEY` - The access key of the HuaweiCloud to use.

* `HW_SECRET_KEY` - The secret key of the HuaweiCloud to use.

You should be able to use any HuaweiCloud environment to develop on as long as the above environment variables are set.
