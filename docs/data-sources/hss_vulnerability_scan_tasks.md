# huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_scan_tasks

Use this data source to get the list of vulnerability scan tasks.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_scan_tasks" "test" {
  enterprise_project_id = "all_granted_eps"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to query the resource.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.

* `scan_type` - (Optional, String) Specifies the scan task type.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **manual**
  + **schedule**

* `task_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the scan task ID.

* `min_start_time` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the minimum start time of ascan task.

* `max_start_time` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the maximum start time of ascan task.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the enterprise project ID.
  This parameter is valid only when the enterprise project is enabled.
  The default value is **0**, indicating the default enterprise project.
  If you need to query data for all enterprise projects, the value is **all_granted_eps**.
  If you only have permissions for a specific enterprise project, you need set the enterprise project ID. Otherwise,
  the operation may fail due to insufficient permissions.
