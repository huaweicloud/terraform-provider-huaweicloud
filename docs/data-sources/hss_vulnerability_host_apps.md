# huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_host_apps

Use this data source to get the list of HSS vulnerability host applications within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "host_id" {}

data "huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_host_apps" "test" {
  host_id = var.host_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to query the data source.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.

* `host_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the host ID.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the enterprise project ID.
  The default value is **0**, indicating the default enterprise project.
  If you need to query data for all enterprise projects, the value is **all_granted_eps**.
  If you only have permissions for a specific enterprise project, you need set the enterprise project ID. Otherwise,
  the operation may fail due to insufficient permissions.

* `vul_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the vulnerability ID.

* `handle_status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the vulnerability disposal status.
  The valid values are **handled** and **unhandled**.

* `container_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the container ID with vulnerabilities.

* `is_container` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether it is a container scene.
  The valid values are **true** and **false**.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The data source ID in UUID format.

* `total_num` - The total number.

* `data_list` - The list of vulnerability host applications.

  The [data_list](#data_list_struct) structure is documented below.

<a name="data_list_struct"></a>
The `data_list` block supports:

* `app_name` - The application name.

* `paths` - The list of software paths with vulnerabilities, when only querying vulnerability types such as
  vulnerabilities and emergency vulnerabilities with software paths, this field exists.

  The [paths](#paths_struct) structure is documented below.

* `rule` - The matching rules for software hit vulnerabilities.

<a name="paths_struct"></a>
The `paths` block supports:

* `app_path` - The software paths with vulnerabilities.

* `app_version` - The application version.

* `status` - The vulnerability status.  
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **vul_status_unfix**: Indicates not fixed.
  + **vul_status_ignored**: Indicates ignored.
  + **vul_status_verified**: Indicates verification in progress.
  + **vul_status_fixing**: Indicates fixing is in progress.
  + **vul_status_fixed**: Indicates fix succeeded.
  + **vul_status_reboot**: Indicates the issue is fixed and waiting for restart.
  + **vul_status_failed**: Indicates the issue failed to be fixed.
  + **vul_status_fix_after_reboot**: Indicates restart the host and try again.
