# huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_hosts

Use this data source to get the list of hosts affected by a vulnerability.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "vul_id" {}
variable "type" {}

data "huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_hosts" "test" {
  vul_id = var.vul_id
  type   = var.type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to query the resource.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.

* `vul_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the ID of the vulnerability.

* `type` - (Required, String) Specifies the vulnerability type.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **linux_vul**: Linux vulnerability.
  + **windows_vul**: Windows vulnerability.
  + **web_cms**: Web-CMS vulnerability.
  + **app_vul**: Application vulnerability.
  + **urgent_vul**: Emergency vulnerability.

* `host_name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the name of the host.

* `host_ip` - (Optional, String) Specifies the IP address of the host.

* `status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the vulnerability status.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **vul_status_unfix**: Indicates not fixed.
  + **vul_status_ignored**: Indicates ignored.
  + **vul_status_verified**: Indicates verification in progress.
  + **vul_status_fixing**: Indicates fixing is in progress.
  + **vul_status_fixed**: Indicates fix succeeded.
  + **vul_status_reboot**: Indicates the issue is fixed and waiting for restart.
  + **vul_status_failed**: Indicates the issue failed to be fixed.
  + **vul_status_fix_after_reboot**: Indicates restart the host and try again.

* `asset_value` - (Optional, String) Specifies the asset importance.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **important**
  + **common**
  + **test**

* `group_name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the server group name.

* `handle_status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the handling status.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **unhandled**
  + **handled**

* `severity_level` - (Optional, String) Specifies the risk level.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **Critical**
  + **High**
  + **Medium**
  + **Low**

* `repair_priority` - (Optional, String) Specifies the repair priority.
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **Critical**
  + **High**
  + **Medium**
  + **Low**

* `is_affect_business` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether business are affected.
  The value can be **true** or **false**. Defaults to **false**.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the enterprise project ID to which the hosts belong.  
  This parameter is valid only when the enterprise project is enabled.
  The default value is **0**, indicating the default enterprise project.
  If you need to query data for all enterprise projects, the value is **all_granted_eps**.
  If you only have permissions for a specific enterprise project, you need set the enterprise project ID. Otherwise,
  the operation may fail due to insufficient permissions.
