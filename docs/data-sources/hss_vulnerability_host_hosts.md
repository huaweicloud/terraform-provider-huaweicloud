# huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_host_hosts

Use this data source to get the list of HSS host vulnerability information in the host view within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "huaweicloud_hss_vulnerability_host_hosts" "test" {}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to query the data source.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the enterprise project ID.  
  This parameter is valid only when the enterprise project is enabled.
  The default value is **0**, indicating the default enterprise project.
  If you need to query data for all enterprise projects, the value is **all_granted_eps**.
  If you only have permissions for a specific enterprise project, you need set the enterprise project ID. Otherwise,
  the operation may fail due to insufficient permissions.

* `asset_value` - (Optional, String) Specifies the host asset importance.  
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **important**
  + **common**
  + **test**

* `group_name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the server group to which the host belongs.

* `host_name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the host name.

* `public_ip` - (Optional, String) Specifies the host public ip.

* `private_ip` - (Optional, String) Specifies the host private ip.

* `severity_level` - (Optional, String) Specifies the vulnerability risk level.  
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **Critical**
  + **High**
  + **Medium**
  + **Low**

* `handle_status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the disposal status of the host.  
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **unhandled**: Unhandled.
  + **handled**: Handled.

* `status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the hosts included in the vulnerability status.  
  The valid values are as follows:
  + **vul_status_unfix**: Indicates not fixed.
  + **vul_status_ignored**: Indicates ignored.
  + **vul_status_verified**: Indicates verification in progress.
  + **vul_status_fixing**: Indicates fixing is in progress.
  + **vul_status_fixed**: Indicates fix succeeded.
  + **vul_status_reboot**: Indicates the issue is fixed and waiting for restart.
  + **vul_status_failed**: Indicates the issue failed to be fixed.
  + **vul_status_fix_after_reboot**: Indicates restart the host and try again.

* `cluster_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the cluster ID.
