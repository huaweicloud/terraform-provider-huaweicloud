# huaweicloud_compute_instances

Use this data source to get the list of the compute instances.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "name_regex" {}

data "huaweicloud_compute_instances" "test" {
  name = var.name_regex
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String) Specifies the region in which to obtain the instances.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used.

* `name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the instance name, which can be queried with a regular expression.
  The instance name supports fuzzy matching query too.

* `instance_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the ECS ID.

* `flavor_name` - (Optional, String) Specifies the flavor name of the instance.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the enterprise project ID.

* `status` - (Optional, String) Specifies the status of the instance. The valid values are as follows:
  + **ACTIVE**: The instance is running properly.
  + **SHUTOFF**: The instance has been properly stopped.
  + **ERROR**: An error has occurred on the instance.

* `image_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the image ID of the instance.

* `flavor_id` - (Optional, String) Specifies the flavor ID.

* `fixed_ip_v4` - (Optional, String)  Specifies the IPv4 addresses of the ECS.

* `availability_zone` - (Optional, String) Specifies the availability zone where the instance is located.
  Please following [reference](https://developer.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/endpoint?ECS) for this argument.

* `key_pair` - (Optional, String) Specifies the key pair that is used to authenticate the instance.
